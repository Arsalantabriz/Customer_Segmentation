The  work will be on real-world customer data to perform market segmentation—which is crucial for businesses to understand customer behaviour and improve marketing efficiency. The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, implementation of clustering algorithms, and interpretation of results. Two popular clustering techniques will be used: k-means and hierarchical clustering.

In the Customer Segmentation in Marketing with Python project, the task will delve into the diversity of customer behaviour and identify distinct segments that could be targeted with personalized marketing strategies.
